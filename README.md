So far for data processing I have 
1. downloaded the dataset of government contracts from sam.gov
2. semantically embedded them in a 768 dimensional vector space with SBERT
3. Dimensionally reduced them to 50 with UMAP
4. Clustered them with HDBScan
5. Dimensionall Reduced them down to 2
6. Displayed them with Plotly

I have modeled the data through clusters but I plan to study clusters and themes throughout contracts and analyze the trends across history

I have done some clustering and have found distinctive clusters around hardware, AI, drone swarms, etc etc etc. But I would like to be able to create comparisons between these clusters as they evolve through time

I will upload the Youtube video and visualization tonight 10/28
